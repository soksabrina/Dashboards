1. Below's visualization is created using the COVID-19 data for counties in California obtained from California Health and Human Services Open Data portal (https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/california-covid-19-hospital-data-and-case-statistics). 
By clicking on the map on the left, the number of confirmed cases within the county will show, and the map on the right will be updated to show the number of COVID-19 positive patients in ICU, and the number of COVID-19 deaths within that selected county. Click outside the map to quit the filter.
